# My Portfolio repository 
See samples of my code:) Enjoy!

## Description
This repository contains two Python programs designed to assist users in a functional and clear way:
1. Task Manager (task_manager.py): A program for managing tasks, allowing users to register new users, add tasks, view all tasks, view tasks assigned to them, generate reports, and display statistics.
2. Investment and Bond Calculator (investment_bond_calculator.py): A program to calculate interest earned on investments and estimate monthly repayments for home loans (bonds).

## 1. Task Manager
- The `task_manager.py` file contains a task management program.
- Users can register new users, add tasks, view all tasks, view tasks assigned to them, generate reports, and display statistics.
- Task data is stored in text files (`tasks.txt` and `user.txt`).

## 2. Investment and Bond Calculator
- The `investment_bond_calculator.py` file contains a financial calculator program.
- Users can calculate interest earned on investments (simple or compound) and estimate monthly repayments for home loans (bonds).

## 3. Usage
- Each Python file can be run independently to perform its respective functionality.
- Users can follow the instructions provided within each program to input necessary data and obtain results.
- Ensure Python is installed on your system to run the programs.
